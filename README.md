## Conclusion
---------------
This analysis visualizes and compares rape cases across Indian states, breaking down the data by age groups and case types (incest, other, total). The findings highlight significant state-wise and age-wise disparities, with many victims being minors. These insights emphasize the urgent need for targeted prevention, policy action, and support services to address and reduce sexual violence in India.

## Key Insights
---------------

### üìà Temporal Trends
- While overall trends show fluctuations, consistent patterns emerge in the **age distribution of victims**.
- The age group **below 18** shows significant numbers across various categories, indicating a persistent **vulnerability** within this demographic.

### üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Distribution
- **Four states**‚Äî**Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh**, and **Maharashtra**‚Äîconsistently report the **highest number of cases** over the years.

### üßÆ Data Quality Considerations
- **Inconsistent column names** and **missing data** across different years limit the scope of analysis and the reliability of long-term trends.
- Further **data cleaning and standardization** are crucial to extract more robust conclusions.
- Future analyses could benefit from incorporating **demographic and socioeconomic factors** to provide richer insights.

### üîç Incest vs. Other Rape Cases
- Analyzing the **ratio and normalized percentages** of incestuous versus other rape cases can provide important insights.
- Rising or falling trends in these metrics may reflect **changes in societal norms** or **reporting patterns**.
- It's crucial to examine the **specific context of each state** when interpreting these results.

### üìä Age-wise Distribution
1. Across the years, the **age group below 18** consistently shows a **high percentage** in the categories of incest, other, and total rape cases.
2. **Incest rape cases involving minors** are approximately **50%** of total incest cases.
3. **More than 50%** of total rape cases belong to the **18‚Äì30 year** age category.
4. **Focused and tailored interventions** are necessary for these vulnerable demographics.

## üìà Future Work

- Predictive modeling of case outcomes
- Natural language processing of FIR narratives
- Interactive dashboard development
- Policy impact analysis of 2013 legal reforms
